Artemis Financial is a fictional financial company that has hired the services of a fictional software engineering company, Global Rain to develop some software that they wish to use to modernize their services and make them secure. To that end, they tasked Global Rain who in turn set me on the task of helping them add a file verification step to their spring framework web application.

I find it important to code securely to protect user data and to ensure that no time is wasted during development. The value that software security adds to a company's overall well-being is one of consumer trust and the ability to continue operating without infringing regulatory guidelines that may cause pain to the company, financial or otherwise.

The most helpful part of vulnerability assessment would have to be the fact that it provides a solid guideline to see where changes, additions, or even removals from a project may be necessary to improve the operability and/or security of a project.

I increased the layers of security by introducing security certificates, checksum verification, and the introduction of an algorithmic cipher to encrypt private data.

I made certain the code and software were functional and secure by testing it, running it through multiple dependency checks, and refactoring it where appropriate. After refactoring the code I used the OWASP Maven dependency check tool to whether or not I introduced new vulnerabilities.

The resources, tools, and/or coding practices that I used that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks would have to be the aforementioned Maven Dependency check, as well as the documentation that different frameworks and coding languages provide online such as the Spring Framework guide on their own website.

If an Employer asked for examples of work that I have completed to show my skills from this course would be the template and refactored code that fell within the scope of project two.
