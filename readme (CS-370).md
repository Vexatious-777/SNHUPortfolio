The work I did on the included Juypter Notebook file was primarily the creation of the algorithm that enabled the intelligent agent provided for me to traverse a maze that was also provided for me and learn from each maze traversal. The algorithm consisted of a for loop that enabled the agent to iterate through multiple mazes while updating its Q-values until it was able to solve the maze with a high percentage and consistent win rate. This then enabled the agent to complete a final maze without reaching a fail state. Admittedly, the hardest part was finding out the rate at which it should update those values and how long its "memory" of past attempts should be. My final build was able to solve the maze and satisfy the win rate condition, however, it took a long time to "learn" this task (about 40 mins if I remember correctly).



Computer Scientists work to advance the field of computer software and create/implement solutions to problems within the computing world and beyond. This can take many forms from something like creating an application meant to help someone organize their day-to-day notes, creating software meant to facilitate the process of space exploration in the form of creating software meant to enable unmanned space missions, to allowing someone to enjoy their leisure time with a game. This matters in many different ways in my eyes, computer scientists can help improve the world they live in by helping others as well as themselves by enabling the automation of some tasks, enabling people to go beyond what they are capable of by themselves through software tools that grant them abilities, they may not otherwise be capable of on their own to perform their day to day tasks and to assist in their daily lives.


I approach problems as a computer scientist by first looking at the requirements of the project brought to me. Then I would follow that by first planning on the best way to solve the requirements and meet them appropriately. Then implement my solutions and test for errors or areas of potential concern. Once, I have a working solution I would then see if there are any areas where it could be improved upon and ask for second opinions if I am working within a team environment. I would not want to fall prey to hubris and think my solution is the only one when another solution might be a better solution to the problem.


My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization are to deliver on end-user demands to the best of my ability. While also ensuring the work I have completed is scalable, error-free, and secure for both the end-user and the organization. It is also my responsibility to raise my concerns with any end-user or organization requirements that may be unsafe or illegal to ensure we can proceed with our tasks legally and correctly. For example, if I worked for a financial organization and noticed that one of our builds has a major security issue wherein end-user data may be at risk and a fix is possible, rather than just calling it a day this concern should be raised and acted on immediately.
